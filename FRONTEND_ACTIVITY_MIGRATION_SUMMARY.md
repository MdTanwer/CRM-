# Frontend Activity System Migration Summary

## Overview

The frontend has been successfully updated to support the new separated activity system that distinguishes between employee and admin activities. This document summarizes all the changes made to integrate with the backend's separated activity collections (`empactivity` and `adminactivity`).

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Activity Service (`frontend/src/services/activities.service.ts`)

**New Features:**

- **Dual API Support**: Added support for both employee (`/api/v1/employee-activities`) and admin (`/api/v1/admin-activities`) endpoints
- **Smart User Type Detection**: Automatically determines user type from user data or context
- **Fallback Support**: Maintains backward compatibility with legacy API endpoints
- **New Activity Types**: Added comprehensive type definitions for both employee and admin activities

**New Functions:**

- `getUserType()` - Determines if user is admin or employee
- `getActivityApiUrl()` - Returns appropriate API URL based on user type
- `getActivitiesForUser()` - Get activities for specific user (employee activities only)
- `getCriticalAdminActivities()` - Get critical admin activities
- `getSystemActivities()` - Get system-related admin activities
- `getEmployeeManagementActivities()` - Get employee management admin activities
- `createActivity()` - Create new activities using the smart utility system

**Enhanced Functions:**

- All existing functions now support user type detection and route to appropriate endpoints
- Automatic fallback to legacy API if new endpoints fail

### 2. Updated Socket Service (`frontend/src/services/socketService.ts`)

**New Event Support:**

- `employee_activity_update` - Dedicated event for employee activities
- `admin_activity_update` - Dedicated event for admin activities
- Maintains backward compatibility with legacy `activity_update` event

**New Subscription Methods:**

- `onEmployeeActivityUpdate()` - Subscribe to employee-specific activities
- `onAdminActivityUpdate()` - Subscribe to admin-specific activities
- Enhanced callback system with separate notification channels

**Enhanced Features:**

- Updated RealtimeActivity interface with new fields (userType, priority, userId, userName)
- Improved event emission methods for different activity types
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. Updated User Socket Service (`frontend/src/services/userSocket.service.ts`)

**New Methods:**

- `onEmployeeActivityUpdate()` - Employee-specific activity subscription
- `onAdminActivityUpdate()` - Admin-specific activity subscription
- Enhanced callback notification system

**Improved Features:**

- Support for new activity event types
- Better separation of concerns for different user types
- Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities

### 4. New User Type Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useUserType.ts`)

**Purpose:**

- Centralized user type detection and management
- Automatic determination from localStorage or user context
- Loading state management for async user type resolution

**Returns:**

- `userType` - "admin" | "employee"
- `isAdmin` - Boolean flag
- `isEmployee` - Boolean flag
- `isLoading` - Loading state

### 5. Updated Constants (`frontend/src/constants/index.ts`)

**New Constants:**

- `EMPLOYEE_ACTIVITY_TYPES` - All employee activity types
- `ADMIN_ACTIVITY_TYPES` - All admin activity types
- `EMPLOYEE_ENTITY_TYPES` - Entity types for employee activities
- `ADMIN_ENTITY_TYPES` - Entity types for admin activities
- `ACTIVITY_PRIORITIES` - Priority levels for admin activities
- `ACTIVITY_TYPE_COLORS` - Color mapping for all activity types
- `ACTIVITY_PRIORITY_COLORS` - Color mapping for priority levels

### 6. Enhanced Type Definitions (`frontend/src/types/index.ts`)

**New Types:**

- `EmployeeActivityType` - Union type for employee activities
- `AdminActivityType` - Union type for admin activities
- `EmployeeEntityType` - Entity types for employee context
- `AdminEntityType` - Entity types for admin context
- `ActivityPriority` - Priority levels (low, medium, high, critical)

**New Interfaces:**

- `BaseActivity` - Common activity properties
- `EmployeeActivity` - Employee-specific activity interface
- `AdminActivity` - Admin-specific activity interface with priority
- `AnyActivity` - Union type for all activity types

### 7. Updated Activity Feed Component (`frontend/src/components/dashboard/ActivityFeed.tsx`)

**New Features:**

- **Smart User Type Detection**: Automatically detects and adapts to user type
- **Contextual Event Subscription**: Subscribes to appropriate activity events based on user type
- **Enhanced UI Indicators**: Shows user type, priority levels, and connection status
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better fallback mechanisms and error states

**Visual Enhancements:**

- User type badges (admin/employee)
- Priority level indicators for admin activities
- Real-time connection status indicator
- Activity type color coding
- Unread activity highlighting

### 8. Updated User Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/UserDashboardPage.tsx`)

**Integration Improvements:**

- Uses new `useUserType` hook for consistent user type detection
- Subscribes to appropriate activity events based on user type
- Enhanced test activity creation using new API
- Better Socket.IO integration with user type awareness

**Development Features:**

- Enhanced debug panel showing user type and connection status
- Test activity creation using new separated system
- Real-time activity refresh capabilities

### 9. New Activities Page (`frontend/src/pages/ActivitiesPage.tsx`)

**Comprehensive Activity Management:**

- **Admin Dashboard**: Tabbed interface with sections for:
  - All Activities
  - Critical Activities (priority-based filtering)
  - System Activities
  - Employee Management Activities
- **Employee Dashboard**: Focused view of relevant employee activities
- **Real-time Updates**: Live activity updates via Socket.IO
- **Interactive Features**:
  - Mark activities as read
  - Delete activities
  - Create test activities
  - Pagination support

**Advanced Features:**

- Activity type selection based on user permissions
- Priority level display for admin activities
- Real-time connection status monitoring
- Responsive design with proper user experience
